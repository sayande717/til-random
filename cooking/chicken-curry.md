# **Chicken Curry**

## Ingredients:
- Food items:
    - `chicken` [medium cut]
    - `onion`, `garlic`, `ginger`, `chilli` [for masala]
    - `sugar`, `salt`
- Utensils:
    - `Kadhai`
    - `Spud` (Khunti)
    - `Mixer Grinder` or similar

## Time needed = `1.5 hours`
- `30 minutes` (preparation)
- `1 hour` (cooking)

## Steps:
1. Prepare the paste for the chicken.
    - Cut the onion, garlic, ginger.
    - Make a paste out of it.
2. Mix the chicken thoroughly with the paste.
3. Allow it to marinate for 30/60 minutes.
4. Put the Kadhai on the flame, and put some oil on it. Allow the oil to heat.
    > For example, put 4 teaspoons of oil for 1kg chicken.
5. Roast onions & tej patta (optional) in the oil.
    > A **red tint** on the onion indicates that they have been roasted properly.
6. Pour the marinated chicken pieces slowly.
7. Keep stirring in order to prevent the preparation from sticking to the walls of the kadhai. A **dark red** tint indicates that the chicken has been cooked.
    > You usually need to do this for 40-50 minutes.
8. Taste the chicken, add salt/sugar if necessary.
9. When the preparation dries up and you determine that it's not cooked enough, slowly add water & keep stirring.
    > The amount of water added in this step should be according to the amount of gravy you want.
